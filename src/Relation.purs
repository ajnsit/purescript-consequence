-- Operations ------------------------------------

-- Use `relation` to proxy for unimplemented functions

-- Due to complications with duplicate labels, some of these types are pretty long. Could they be simplified?
-- Also consider duplicate labels, but different types. Are those handled by Nub?

-- | An empty relation
empty :: Relation ()

-- | Create a relation from an array of records

  . Array (Record r)
  -> Relation r

-- | Select some columns from a relation
-- TODO: Instead of RProxy, we should use List SProxy/Field.

  -> Relation r

-- | Remove some columns from a relation

-- Group By ------------------------------------------
